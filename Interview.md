## My study plan

- [x] [How to prepare for technical interviews (12 minute YouTube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbRSDn5YK_k)
- [ ] [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms (30 hour Udemy course)](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms)
- [ ] [Leetcode Prep Work (4 minute Medium article)](https://bit.ly/2ZjAkBf)
- [ ] Whiteboard all algorithms and data structures in preferred language at least twice
- [ ] [Cracking the Coding Interview book](https://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)
- [ ] At least 40 leetcode.com

## Daily

1. Learn a new algorithm or data structure
1. Do at least 2 problems from Cracking the Coding Interview
1. Do at least 2 problems from leetcode.com

## Leetcode

It's recommended to get premium so that you can select questions from your top 3 
companies. Some guidelines for doing leetcode:

1. Close all apps and unnecessary browser tabs
1. Get a few pens and a stack of paper (at least 8.5 x 11 size)
1. Set a 25 minute timer per problem
      1. Use the first 5 minutes to understand the problem
      1. Use the next 20 minutes to hand write a solution
      1. If you get stuck review a hint (not the solution if possible)
1. Spend 10 minutes reading about the solution and take notes
1. Revisit the problem in a week
1. Only spend 2-4 hours per day on this (otherwise you burn out)
1. Take at least on day off per week
1. Do at least 40 questions (a mix of easy and medium)
1. Try a few hard questions

## Interview prep

Companies are looking for the following skills:
1. Analytic Skills - How can you think through problems and analyze things?
1. Coding Skills - Do you code well, by writing clean, simple, organized, readable code?
1. Technical knowledge - Do you know the fundamentals of the job you're applying for?
1. Communication skills: Does your personality match the companiesâ€™ culture?

Throughout the interview, do the following:
1. Ask for clarification (for first 5 minutes or less)
1. Sketch a diagram of the problem
1. Constantly think out loud (like pair programming)
1. Write pseudo code before actual code
1. Consider invalid input and edge cases
1. Write out the code
1. Test your solution by hand (use an input/output table)

## Questions for code challenges

1. **Inputs:** Will they vary (string, int, etc.)? What's considered invalid? What's the range?
1. **Big O:** For this algorithm what's more important, time or space effeciency?
