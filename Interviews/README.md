## My study plan

I don't necessarily do these in order. I may take a break from one source and jump to another.
Or I may use a different source to supplement my learning on a particular topic 
(Linked Lists for example). I'll also do a couple leetcode easy problems based on material
I've already covered.

This [Technical Interview mind map](https://bit.ly/2lgDBmp) looks intimidating at first but
[the Udemy course](https://bit.ly/2PdJzmF) gets you through it.

## Things to revisit

- [ ] Big O notation chapter in Cracking the Coding Interview
- [ ] [Binary Heap video on Udemy](https://bit.ly/2ly9reI)
- [ ] Problems on my **Revisit** list on Leetcode

## Daily

1. Learn a new algorithm or data structure
1. Do at least 2-5 problems from Cracking the Coding Interview
1. Do at least 2-5 problems from leetcode.com
1. Spend at least 2-4 hours per day (except Saturday)
1. Update [Coding Interview Prep Progress Sheet](https://bit.ly/2L1efmY) and review the notes

## Leetcode

It's recommended to get premium so that you can select the most frequent 
questions from your top 3 companies. Some guidelines for doing leetcode:

1. Close all apps and unnecessary browser tabs
1. Get a few pens and a stack of paper (at least 8.5 x 11 size)
1. Set a 25 minute timer per problem
      1. Use the first 5 minutes to understand the problem
      1. Use the next 20 minutes to hand write a solution
      1. If you get stuck review a hint (not the solution if possible)
1. Spend 10 minutes reading about the solution and take notes
1. Revisit the problem in a week
1. Only spend 2-4 hours per day on this (otherwise you burn out)
1. Take at least on day off per week
1. Do at least 40 questions (a mix of easy and medium)
1. Try a few hard questions

## Interview prep

Companies are looking for the following skills:
1. **Analytic Skills:** How can you think through problems and analyze things?
1. **Coding Skills:** Do you code well, by writing clean, simple, organized, readable code?
1. **Technical knowledge:** Do you know the fundamentals of the job you're applying for?
1. **Communication skills:** Does your personality match the companiesâ€™ culture?

Throughout the interview, do the following:
1. Ask for clarification (for first 5 minutes or less)
1. Write a summary of all relevant information
1. Sketch a detailed diagram of the problem
1. Constantly think out loud (like pair programming)
1. Write Brute force pseudo code before actual code
1. Write `TODOs` for invalid input and edge cases
1. Write out the code
      1. Extract "initialization" code to functions. Ex: `lookup = init_roman_numeral_lookup()`
      1. Fill in the details later if time permitting
      1. Always derive the Big O, don't guess
1. Test your solution by hand (use an input/output table)
      1. Start with smaller inputs

### Additional requirements

1. 1+ recent project(s) to show and tell
1. 1+ algorithm(s) to show and tell

## Questions for code challenges

1. **Inputs:** Will they vary (string, int, etc.)? What's considered invalid? What's the range?
1. **Big O:** For this algorithm what's more important, time or space efficiency?
