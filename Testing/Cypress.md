# Cypress

- Cypress is a front end Automation testing tool built for the modern web applications
- Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.
- Ability to test Edge Test cases by Mocking the server response
- Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. We can hover over each commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.
- View videos of your entire tests execution when run from the Cypress Dashboard.
- Cypress engine directly operates inside the browser
- listen and modify the browser behavior at run time by manipulating DOM and altering Network requests and responses on the fly
